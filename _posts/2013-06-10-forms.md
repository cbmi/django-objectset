django-objectset comes with a simple function for creating forms that that interface with `ObjectSet`-based models called `objectset_form_factory`.

An example:

```python
from objectset.forms import objectset_form_factory
from books.models import ReadingList, Book

# Create a new form class based on an ObjectSet
ReadingListForm = objectset_form_factory(ReadingList)

# My initial reading list...
books = Book.objects.filter(author__name='Douglas Hofstadter')

# Forms use a generic 'objects' field.. more on this below
form = ReadingListForm({'objects': books})

# Of course!
assert form.is_valid()

# All done
reading_list = form.save()
```

For the curious, the above example's hand-coded form would look like this:

```python
from django import forms

queryset = Book.objects.all()

class ReadingListForm(forms.ModelForm):
    objects = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset, label='books', required=False)

    def save(commit=True):
        self.instance._pending = self.cleaned_data.get('objects')
        return super(ReadingListForm, self).save(commit=commit)

    class Meta(object):
        model = ReadingList
        exclude = ('books',)
```

Forms use a generic `objects` field name and explicitly _exclude_ the real related field. This is primarily for the benefit of consumers of these forms when dealing with different _kinds_ of sets. The related name varies across sets, so using this approach makes forms easier to work with. As shown, the label for the field is maintained for display purposes.

In addition to the `model` argument, `objectset_form_factory` also takes an optional `queryset` argument which will be used for the `ModelMultipleChoiceField` for limiting the scope of objects.
